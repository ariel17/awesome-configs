Description
***********

This is my version for the configuration of Awesome Window Manager
(http://awesome.naquadah.org/). It just links the current repositoty to the
default config directory in Ubuntu distribution.

In my work, I have 2 PCs connected between through Synergy
(http://synergy-foss.org/), one named "Gabrielle" and other "Natalie" (I always
use women names). Although I choose Ubuntu anytime I must install from
scratch an OS, some preference in those machines are not same; basically
because Gabrielle is a notebook and Natalie is a desktop :).


Installing new configurations
*****************************

I've used Fabric (http://docs.fabfile.org/en/1.3.1/index.html) to automate
installation. If some changes has been done, to install them is necessary to
run the command `sudo fab install:girl=gabrielle` (or `girl=natalie`) and if
the syntax is OK a legend appears:

`✔ Configuration file syntax OK.`
`You can reload your new configuration (or start) Awesome WM.`

But if instead there is an error in the file, a message like this appears:

`✘ Configuration file syntax error.`
`Fatal error: local() encountered an error (return code 1) while executing '/usr/bin/awesome --config /etc/xdg/awesome/rc.lua --check'`
`Aborting.`



That's all :). I hope this be usefull for someone. Enjoy!
